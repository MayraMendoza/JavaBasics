when a program runs it will start from the main method.

 public static String fullName(String first, String last) {
        String fullName = first + " " + last;

        return fullName;

if you remove static from the line above ^ it will give you an error
main will always be static ---
you will need to add static to other methods in the same class. (there is a workaround for this but it is best practice to be consistent with static troughout the program)

public String fullName(String first, String last) {
        String fullName = first + " " + last;

        return fullName;

  to use it without static
  you will have to declare a new instance like this within thw main
  string createdName = new main createFullName (first, Last)
